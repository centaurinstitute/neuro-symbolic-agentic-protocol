# NSAI-0008 The value Property

## Description

The `.value` accessor provides a mechanism to retrieve the current value of a variable or instance property without establishing a dependency relationship in the Logic Graph. This is useful when you want to capture a snapshot of a value at a specific moment without creating reactive behavior. When `.value` is used, future changes to the source variable will not trigger automatic updates in the dependent expression.

## Examples

### Variable value accessor

```python
rate = 1.15
```

```python
class Balance:
    def __init__(self):
        self.amount = 0
```

```python
balance1 = Balance()
balance1.amount = 1000 * rate.value
```

```python
> balance1.amount
1150
```

### No automatic update when using .value

```python
rate = 1.25
```

```python
> balance1.amount
1150
```

The `amount` remains `1150` because `rate.value` captured a snapshot without creating a dependency. If `rate` (without `.value`) had been used instead, `balance1.amount` would have automatically updated to `1250`.

### Instance value accessor

```python
class Stock:
    rate = 0.05
    def __init__(self, amount):
        self.amount = amount
```

```python
stock1 = Stock(5)
stock1.total = 22.5 * stock1.amount * stock1.rate.value
```

This captures the current value of `stock1.rate` without making `stock1.total` dependent on future changes to the class-level `rate` property.
