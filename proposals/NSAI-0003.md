# NSAI-0003 Classes and Instances

## Description

Classes in NSAIP define templates for creating objects that are tracked within the Logic Graph. Each class declaration establishes both a type definition and a storage collection for instances. The `__init__` method specifies how instances are initialized with their properties. When a class is defined, it becomes a first-class entity in the runtime, enabling class-level queries, computed properties, and declarative rules that apply to all instances.

Instance properties can be assigned both during initialization (via `__init__`) and after instance creation through direct property assignment. Each instance is registered in the class collection and stored as a node in the Logic Graph, making it queryable and subject to class-level declarative rules.

## Examples

### Basic Class Definition

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

```python
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
```

```python
> person1
{ "name": "Alice", "age": 25 }
```

### Dynamic Property Assignment

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
```

```python
vehicle1 = Vehicle("Honda")
vehicle1.color = "red"
```

```python
> vehicle1
{ "model": "Honda", "color": "red" }
```
