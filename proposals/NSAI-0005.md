# NSAI-0005 Declarative Variable Dependencies

## Description

Variable-level declarative statements demonstrate the core reactive behavior of NSAIP. When variable `b` is defined as an expression involving `a`, the runtime creates a dependency edge from `a` to `b`. Subsequently, any reassignment to `a` triggers automatic recalculation of `b`, ensuring the relationship `b = a + 2` remains valid throughout execution. This establishes persistent relationships in the Logic Graph that automatically maintain consistency as values change.

## Examples

```python
a = 1
b = a + 2
```

```python
> a
1
> b
3
```

### Automatic propagation when dependency changes

```python
a = 2
```

```python
> a
2
> b
4
```

The variable `b` automatically updates to reflect the new value of `a`, maintaining the declarative relationship `b = a + 2` throughout the program execution.
