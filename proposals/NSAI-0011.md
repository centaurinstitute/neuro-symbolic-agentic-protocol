# NSAI-0011 Compound Class Statements

## Description

Compound class statements express relationships and computed properties that span multiple classes. When one class references properties of another class through object composition, the runtime creates transitive dependency chains through the Logic Graph. These cross-class dependencies enable complex reasoning patterns where changes to one object automatically propagate through related objects. Class-level computed properties can access nested properties through reference chains, establishing declarative rules that maintain consistency across compositional relationships.

## Examples

```python
class Item:
    def __init__(self, sku, price):
        self.sku = sku
        self.price = price
```

```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self, qty, item):
        self.item = item
        self.qty = qty
```

### Cross-class computed property

```python
Order.total = Order.item.price * Order.qty
```

```python
item1 = Item("1000001", 100)
order1 = Order(2, item1)
```

```python
> order1.total
200
```

### Automatic propagation across class boundaries

```python
item1.price = 150
```

```python
> order1.total
300
```

The `total` property automatically updates when the referenced `item1.price` changes, demonstrating transitive dependency tracking through object composition across multiple classes.
