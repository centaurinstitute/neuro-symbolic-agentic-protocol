# NSAI-0002 Local Variable

## Description

Local variables are scoped to a specific context, such as within a function body or conditional block. They can reference global variables while maintaining their own local scope. Local variables participate in the same dependency tracking mechanism as global variables, but their lifetime and visibility are limited to their enclosing scope.

## Examples

```python
radius = 10
volume = None
```

```python
    area = (radius ** 2) * 3.14
    global volume
    volume = area * 5
```

```python
> radius
10
> volume
1570
```
