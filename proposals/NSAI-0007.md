# NSAI-0007 Class Level Declarative Statements

## Description

Class-level declarative statements define properties or rules that apply universally to all instances of a class. When a property is assigned at the class level, it becomes accessible through all instances of that class. This enables the expression of universal facts and shared characteristics across an entire class of objects, establishing declarative rules that automatically apply to every instance.

## Examples

```python
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

### Universal property assignment

```python
Human.mortal = True
```

```python
human1 = Human("socrates")
```

```python
> human1.mortal
True
```

The `mortal` property is defined at the class level and automatically applies to all instances of `Human`, including those created after the class-level assignment. This demonstrates how universal truths can be expressed declaratively in NSAIP.
