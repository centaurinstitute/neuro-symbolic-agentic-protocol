# NSAI-0010 Imperative Mode

## Description

While NSAIP operates primarily in a declarative mode, certain situations require traditional imperative execution where statements execute once without establishing persistent dependencies. The `@Imperative` decorator marks statements for one-time execution, preventing the runtime from creating dependency edges or automatically updating values when dependencies change. Alternatively, using the `.value` accessor achieves the same result. This is useful for initialization code, side-effect operations, or scenarios where reactive behavior would be inappropriate.

## Examples

### Using @Imperative decorator

```python
a = 1
@Imperative
b = a + 2
```

```python
> a
1
> b
3
```

```python
a = 2
```

```python
> a
2
> b
3
```

The value of `b` remains `3` even after `a` changes to `2`, because the `@Imperative` decorator prevented the creation of a dependency relationship.

### Using .value accessor (alternative approach)

```python
a = 1
b = a.value + 2
```

```python
> a
1
> b
3
```

```python
a = 2
```

```python
> a
2
> b
3
```

Both approaches produce the same imperative behavior, where `b` is computed once and does not automatically update when `a` changes.
