# NSAI-0006 Instance Level Declarative Statements

## Description

Instance-level declarative statements define conditional rules that apply to specific object instances. These rules are stored in the Logic Graph and automatically re-evaluate when the properties they depend on change. This enables reactive behavior where changes to one property automatically trigger updates to related properties based on declarative constraints.

## Examples

```python
class Project:
    def __init__(self, name, status):
        self.name = name
        self.status = status
```

```python
library_project = Project("Library Project", "started")
```

### Conditional rule on instance

```python
if library_project.status == "completed":
    library_project.archive = True
```

When `library_project.status` changes to `"completed"`, the `archive` property will automatically be set to `True`, demonstrating reactive behavior at the instance level.

```python
library_project.status = "completed"
```

```python
> library_project.archive
True
```
