# NSAI-0009 Conditional Declarative Statements

## Description

Conditional statements at the class level define declarative rules that automatically re-evaluate when their predicate conditions change. The if-else structure creates branching logic nodes in the Logic Graph, and the appropriate branch is activated based on the current state. When an instance property changes and affects the condition, the runtime automatically updates the dependent properties according to the active branch, maintaining logical consistency throughout execution.

## Examples

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
```

### Class-level conditional rule

```python
if Account.balance < 1500:
    Account.status = "low"
else:
    Account.status = "normal"
```

```python
account1 = Account(2000)
```

```python
> account1.status
"normal"
```

### Automatic re-evaluation when condition changes

```python
account1.balance = 1000
```

```python
> account1.status
"low"
```

The `status` property automatically updates when `balance` changes, demonstrating how conditional declarative statements maintain logical consistency by re-evaluating rules as their dependencies change.
