# NSAI-0001 Global Variable

## Description 

Global variables are declared at the root level and remain accessible throughout the program execution. When a global variable is assigned an expression containing other variables, the runtime establishes dependency relationships that enable automatic propagation of changes. The following example demonstrates a simple global variable declaration and a dependent variable that automatically updates when its dependency changes.

## Examples

```python
pi = 3.14
```

```python
area_of_circle = 4 * pi ** 2
```

```python
> pi
3.14
> area_of_circle
39.4384
```
